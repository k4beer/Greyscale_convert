# Greyscale\_convert

CUDA based RGB to greyscale code



Hello, welcome to cuda based code to execute rgb to greyscale conversion. Please follow these steps to change the colour of images. 

1. Use the make clean build command to create the executable file.
2. The syntax for the CLI is ./convertRGBToGrey.exe -i input.png -o output.png. the output image is greyscaled



Clone repository to run on CUDA compliant machines with up to date runtimes. Code written and executed on Google Collab in the absence of a Nvidia GPU. Random images generated using python and their greyscaled versions can be found in the obviously named directories. A comparison image is also available to see them side by side.
